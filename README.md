misc-docs
=========

This repo collects documentation I'm writing for myself based on other sources, testing, and head-pounding. Writing documentation helps me understand what I'm working on and makes it easier to remember how something worked six months from now. If it helps someone else, great.

Different topics are grouped in folders.
