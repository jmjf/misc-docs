misc-docs
=========

This repo collects documentation I'm writing for myself based on other sources, testing, and head-pounding. Writing documentation helps me understand what I'm working on and makes it easier to remember how something worked six months from now or why I thought it might be a good idea to set it up that way. Everything is subject to revision as I find what does and does not works. If these documents help someone else, great.
